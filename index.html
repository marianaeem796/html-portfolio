      <h3> ***Origin of Henna***</h3> 
<p>
The art of henna (called mehndi or mehendi in Hindi & Urdu languages) has been practiced for over 5000 Origin of Hennayears in Pakistan, India, Africa and the Middle East. Some documentation dates it to over 9000 years old.  Because henna has natural cooling properties, people of the desert, for centuries, have been using henna to help control their body temperature.  They would make a paste from the crushed dried leaves of the henna plant and soak their palms and soles of the feet in it to get a cooling affect.  The cooling sensation was felt throughout the body for as long as the henna stain remained on their skin.  Initially, as the stain faded away, it left patterns on the skin's surface which led to ideas of making designs for decorative purposes.  In the ancient Egyptian times even mummies wore henna designs and it is documented that Cleopatra herself used henna for decorative purposes.

Henna was not only a popular accessory for the rich but the poor, who could not afford jewelry, used it to decorate their bodies as well.</p>

<h3>The Henna Plant</h3>

<p>Henna (Lawsonia inermis, also known as hina, mehndi,henna tree, mignonette tree, Egyptian privet) is a flowering plant that grows 12-15 feet high and comes from the sole species of the Lawsonia genus. 
    The English name "henna" comes from the Arabic term الحناء (al-ḥinnā).  The name henna also refers to the dye prepared from the henna plant and the art of temporary tattooingfrom those dyes.
    Henna has been used for centuries to dye skin, hair, and fingernails, as well as fabrics including silk, wool, and leather. </p> 
    
    
   <p>Henna was used for cosmetic purposes in the Roman Empire, Convivencia-period Iberia and Ancient Egypt, 
    as well as other parts of North Africa, the Horn of Africa, the Arabian Peninsula,
     the Near East and South Asia.  
     It can be found widespread in other hot climates like Pakistan,                                                               
     India and Australia.   
     The plant grows best in heat up to 120F degrees and contains more dye at these temperatures.
    Inversely, it wilts in temperatures below 50F degrees.   
    It also grows better in dry soil, as opposed to damp soil.  
    The leaves are in opposite decussate pairs and vary in sizes from approximately 2-4 cm. long. 
    The flowers are fragrant, produced in conical panicles 1040 cm long, each flower 5 mm diameter, with four white petals. 
    The fruit is a dry capsule 68 mm diameter, containing numerous 12.5 mm seeds. 
    </p> 
   <P> The henna plant contains lawsone which is a reddish-orange dye that binds to the keratin (a protein) in our skin and safely stains the skin.
     The stain can be from pale orange to deep burgundy depending on the quality of the henna and how well ones skin takes it. 
      A good henna, fresh from hot & dry climates,
       will stain the darkest</p>
